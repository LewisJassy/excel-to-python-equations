Saline Aquifer CO₂ Storage Calculation Functions
This documentation outlines the functions and formulas used to estimate CO₂ storage efficiency, plume radius, storage area, reservoir pressure, and density difference in a saline aquifer. Saline aquifers are geological formations filled with saltwater (brine), making them a suitable choice for long-term CO₂ storage due to their low economic value and large volumes.
